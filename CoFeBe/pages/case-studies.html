                        <b>Problem:</b>
                        GreatSchools.org was the victim of a wide scale denial of service attack from the “Anonymous” hacker group which caused disruptions of service for several days.  GreatSchools took a look at their CMS architecture and realized that they needed to harden their infrastructure to provide high availability and disaster recovery to prevent future disruptions.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Our Solution:</b>
                        Thotspots developed an architecture and reference implementation for the GreatSchools Wordpress CMS, which included changing how user requests were routed to servers, expanding GreatSchools hosting to multiple regions in the United States, and a creating synchronization mechanism to ensure that all the servers were up to date with the latest changes to both content and configuration.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Result:</b>
                        Synchronization across all regions happens within minutes.  Load is now spread across multiple regions and multiple servers.  As a side benefit, users are routed to the server closest to their physical location resulting in faster page loads and better all around site performance.  The site can now handle outages of individual servers or even the outage of an entire geographic region.

                        <b>Problem:</b>
                        Veritone was aspirationally the Google of the spoken word. Their goal was to search what we speak on radio and video. How could I search for that hotly debated topic that was just on radio, on a podcast, shown in a TV ad, etc?  Out of the passion to solve this problem Veritone was born. They quickly became the leaders in their industry and partnered with industry heavy weights like ESPN and Draftkings. Both companies and others submitted content to be searched by their respective end customers. ESPN uploaded and/or streamed 1 million unique pieces of content per month. The problem? How do you organize this media? How do you categorize? How do you search? How do you find all videos that contained the words “Kobe Byrant” and “Gatorade?” And how do you do it in sub-second speeds across petabytes of data generated monthly? 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Our Solution:</b>
                        ThotSpots built a directory and a sub-second search platform. The UX/UI for the directory had to be responsive allowing thousands of  users to simultaneously click and drill down and wade through millions of pieces of content. Further, search had to be fast. Leveraging a distributed, NoSQL proprietary database users were able to search for things like “LeBron James” and “Sprite” when there is a basketball shown in the video. The goal of the solution was to provide search as fast as Google and to be able to search for anything said world wide, within five minutes of it being said on public airwaves. The directory allowed media managers that were responsible for content to quickly categorize and organize video and other media content. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Result:</b>
                        Veritone was able to win addition contracts with ESPN. They partnered with Geico and Clear Channel. Today all media managed via their platform is managed by the very same directory and search technology built by the team at ThotSpots.

                        <b>Problem:</b>
                        The founder of Helpkin had a passion. That is, how do you socialize babysitting with your close friends and family, yet make it safe? The mission is to trade babysitting duties with people you trust and save money while doing it. As the demands of work life increase, we are evermore confronted trusting the village it takes to raise children.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Solution:</b>
                        After working with the founders in our ThotSpots Labs, we were able to snap pictures of the whiteboard sessions. It was then we decided that we had to build a mobile application. Sharing pots of coffee and sleepless nights we delivered a mobile experience we believe is the next evolution of babysitting.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Results:</b>
                        Date night is back with rated-R movies. Trust is back in the community. And thousands of users now babyshare, for free.

                        <b>Problem:</b>
                        Zodiac (formally IMS) manufactures and builds inflight entertainment systems for airlines like Lufthansa and American. Millions are entertained daily by watching movies from the seatbacks of the passengers sitting in front of them. Content is of course king and delivering content to million with no hiccups is a challenge. Zodiac partnered with ThotSpots to rebuild their content management system that delivered secured movies over a closed and limited network. The challenge? How do you deliver movies that can’t be stolen and provide a seamless platform in the air when the internet is unreliable at 30,000 feet? 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Solution:</b>
                        Bring out the old guys because it’s all done in C++ on an embedded system out of a technology horror flick. Our team helped redefine the way data was sent enabling more content to be delivered including all metadata. Not only were we able to help rebuild the content delivery system, we became the defacto partner to help troubleshoot issues with their products and subsystem. Even today our team has an office at Zodiac where we continue to collaborate, design, build and debug.

                        <b>Result:</b>
                        Mothers get to put headphones on their children while they fly. Today ThotSpots’ code and bug fixes touch millions of customers, daily.
